## **v1.8.0 — NSFW Guard API & Gallery Integration (2025-12-12)**
### 🛡️ NSFW Guard API Enhancements

### 📂 Architecture Updates

  - `routes/user.py` (Updated information passage)
  - `web/usgromana_settings.js` (updated the middleware and UI architecture)

---

## **v1.5.0 — Modular Refactor & Architecture Overhaul (2025-12-6)**
### 🏗️ Architectural Refactor
- **Monolith Split:** Deconstructed the massive `usgromana.py` into modular route handlers:
  - `routes/auth.py` (Login/Register/Token)
  - `routes/admin.py` (User & Group management)
  - `routes/user.py` (User environment & status)
  - `routes/static.py` (Asset serving)
- **Circular Dependency Resolution:** Introduced `globals.py` to handle shared server instances and `constants.py` to centralize configuration paths.
- **Logic Decoupling:** Moved business logic out of HTTP handlers into dedicated utilities (`utils/admin_logic.py`, `utils/json_utils.py`, `utils/bootstrap.py`).

### 🛠️ Stability & Fixes
- **Startup Resilience:** Added auto-creation logic for missing static folders (`web/css`, `web/js`, `web/html`) to prevent `aiohttp` crash on first run.
- **Windows Pathing:** Fixed `FileNotFoundError` and path resolution issues on Windows environments.
- **Middleware Fixes:** Restored missing `create_folder_access_control_middleware` and fixed import errors in `watcher.py`.
- **Config Correction:** Resolved missing `MAX_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` constant that prevented server startup.

### 📂 Frontend Reorganization
- Restructured `web/` directory for cleaner separation of concerns.
- Consolidated ComfyUI extension scripts (`usgromana_settings.js`, `logout.js`, `injectCSS.js`) to ensure reliable auto-loading.
- Moved HTML templates to `web/html/` and updated static route mappings.
- Removed legacy `admin.js` to prevent conflicts with the integrated Settings UI.
